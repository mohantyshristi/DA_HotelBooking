# Hotel Booking Cancellations Analysis

This project investigates hotel booking cancellations using a dataset of 119k+ records (2015–2017) from City Hotel and Resort Hotel.
The analysis focuses on identifying key factors driving cancellations, estimating the financial impact, and recommending strategies to minimize revenue loss.

# 🔎 Business Problem

Both City and Resort Hotels have been experiencing high cancellation rates, leading to:
Revenue losses
Idle room inventory
Poor demand forecasting
The goal is to provide data-driven insights to reduce cancellations and improve revenue management.

# 📊 Key Insights
37% of all bookings were canceled between 2015–2017.
Resort Hotel shows higher cancellations (~44%) compared to City Hotel (~30%).
TA/TO (Travel Agents/Tour Operators) segment is the riskiest → 41% cancellation rate, representing ~€22M potential revenue at risk.
Higher ADR (room prices) and longer lead times correlate strongly with cancellations.
Cancellations peak during summer months (June–August).

# 💡 Recommendations
Dynamic pricing: Adjust ADR for long-lead-time bookings.
Deposit/prepayment policies: Require partial payments for high-risk channels.
Direct booking incentives: Discounts or loyalty rewards to reduce reliance on travel agents.
Demand forecasting improvements: Better align staffing & resources during peak months.
